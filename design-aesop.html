                        <p>The Salon is a web browser extension accompanied by a microsite designed to encourage art discovery and facilitate Aesop-hosted gatherings, with the aim of bringing people together to take in the unique sensorial experience Aesop stores have to offer. By engaging customers in this way, we hope to extend Aesop's community to a wider circle and create a digital experience that impacts the user in a subtle, yet meaningful way. </p>

                        <h4>The Problem</h4>
                        <p>Currently, Aesop stores host a variety of events which celebrate local art and culture. However, these gatherings are rarely publicized, invitations are only extended to frequent customers, and the method to RSVP to these events is unclear and inconsistent from store to store.</p>

                        <p>Therefore, Aesop limits the opportunity to foster greater brand loyalty from occasional customers who want to engage with the brand, but do not necessarily frequent the stores.</p>

                        <h4>Approach</h4>

                        <p>To get a better understanding of where our intervention will fit in our users' daily lifestyle, we visited the Gastown and Kitsilano Aesop locations in addition to speaking to Aesop customers and individuals who were familiar with the brand. We then created a high-level persona and storyboard to outline the customer profile and experience journey.</p>

                        <h4>The Solution</h4>

                        <p>We designed a web browser extension supported by a microsite, which reveals daily pieces of art, music, or literature within the new tab of a browser window.</p>

                        </div>

                        <h4>Application Breakdown</h4>
                        <p>Each piece of art corresponds with an event held at one of Aesop's locations, giving customers the opportunity to meet the artist, engage with with like-minded people within the local arts scene, and take in the unique sensorial experience offered in Aesop stores. The microsite provides customers with an overview of art that's been featured by Aesop stores all over the globe, offering artist profiles, art analyses, and event discovery.</p>

                        <h4>Reflection</h4>

                        <p>The biggest challenge of this project was acquiring a deep understanding of our users without projecting our own assumptions. Framing brand loyalty as a means of revenue was necessary for us to move forward with conceptualizing The Salon around in-store events. </p>

                        <p>As a team, we learned the importance of setting strict meeting times and creating an equal balance of individual and team work time. To accomplish this, we took the time to plan out our weekly schedule along with daily goals early on in the work week. This was probably the toughest project I’ve done in terms of establishing a working process, but it definitely paid off in the end. </p>

                        <p>In a nutshell, the process can be summed up like this: sleep more, take breaks often, and work smarter in a shorter period of time.</p>

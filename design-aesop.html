                        <h4>Microsite + Browser Extension</h4>

                        <p>The Salon is a web browser extension accompanied by a microsite designed to encourage art discovery and facilitate Aesop-hosted gatherings, with the aim of bringing people together to take in the unique sensorial experience Aesop stores have to offer. By engaging customers in this way, we hope to extend Aesop's community to a wider circle and create a digital experience that impacts the user in a subtle, yet meaningful way. </p>

                        <h4>The Problem</h4>
                        <p>Currently, Aesop stores host a variety of events which celebrate local art and culture. However, these gatherings are rarely publicized, invitations are only extended to frequent customers, and the method to RSVP to these events is unclear and inconsistent from store to store.</p>

                        <p>Therefore, Aesop limits the opportunity to foster greater brand loyalty from occasional customers who want to engage with the brand, but do not necessarily frequent the stores.</p>

                        <h4>Approach</h4>

                        <p>To get a better understanding of where our intervention will fit in our users' daily lifestyle, we created a high-level persona and storyboard to outline the customer profile and experience journey.</p>

                        <h4>The Solution</h4>

                        <p>We designed a web browser extension supported by a microsite, which reveals daily pieces of art, music, or literature within the new tab of a browser window.</p>

                        <p>Each piece of art corresponds with an event held at one of Aesop's locations, giving customers the opportunity to meet the artist, engage with with like-minded people within the local arts scene, and take in the unique sensorial experience offered in Aesop stores. The microsite provides customers with an overview of art that's been featured by Aesop stores all over the globe, offering artist profiles, art analyses, and event discovery.</p>
